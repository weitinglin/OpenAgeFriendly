Due to rapidly growing aging population , to create a aging-friendly city is a urgent government  practice point.  Some indexes to reflect the city's age-friendliness may help the local government to monitor and improve the policy practice and these information also should be open and interactive to the citizen who caring about this issue.  According to WHO 2015 age-friendly city guidelines,  there are eight aspects for a comfort of elder living (outdoor spaces, transportation, housing, social participation, social respect, civic participation, communication, health and community support ). And we use the Taiwan OpenGovernment data, which is a platform stored the different data from government departments ,to integrate indexes and create a shiny app to easily open those data for local citizen.
